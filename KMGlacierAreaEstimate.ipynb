    "The Estimated Glacier Area Calculator is a script that can be used to provide users with an estimation of glacier area change using Landsat satellite data over a multidecadal period. The interactive programming notebook created using Jupyter Lab notebook is intended to provide users with a quick and efficient way to calculate glacier area changes for entire mountain ranges. This project will primarily use the USGS Python Package to identify, download and present Landsat imagery between 1985 - 2024 at the Kenai Mountains in Alaska. The script uses several functions from geospatial packages such as Rasterio, NumPy, and a download USGS python package `(https://github.com/kapadia/usgs)`. All edits and changes to the script have been documented using commits on Github. Github was also used to fork the USGS python package to the working repository.\n"

    "Future versions of this code can includes the following to make the analysis more accurate:-\n",
    "- Increasing the gamma of the trimmed false colour composite images to improve the visibility of cloud covers in each scene. Additionally, incerasing the gamma makes the scene appear brighter and easier to interpret in a visual analysis.\n",
    "- Applying a NDSI (Normalised Difference Snow Index) as opposed to the normalisation used in this study. This will increase the relability of the Glacier mask results as the normalisation method selects all features that has the set reflectance value. This may include clouds in the image or other objects that aren't snow or ice. This may explain why the results of the study appear to be more irregular as it would be expected for glacier area to decrease overtime.\n",
    "- Selecting cloud free imagery to provide better visibility of glacier snow and ice.\n",
    "- Creating a more accurate Bounding Box, future versions could include creating a consistent bounding box for all images as some scenes will include other feature detected as glacier ice and snow is not apart of the Kenai Mountains study area.\n",
    "- Generating a shapefile using the imported `shapely` to generate a shapefile which can display the identified glacier area on GIS and Remote Sensing software such as ArcGIS, QGIS, ArcMap, etc.\n",
    "- Future versions of the script could make the process of analysing each landsat image easier by bulk downloading and processing images rather than processing each image separately."
